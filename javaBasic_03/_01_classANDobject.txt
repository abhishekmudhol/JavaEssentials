- Java is an object-oriented language
- What are objects?
- What are classes?
- How do classes and objects create?

#1
Java is Object- Oriented Programming:-
- In the real world, everything is an object like a pen, mouse, glass, etc.
- Every object has two things:
- An object knows something ( It has some properties)
- An object does something( It has a behaviour)
- Every object has a property and behaviour. It can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- To create an object, first, we need to create a class.
- Class act as a blueprint that contains the designing of an object.

#2
- JVM creates objects in Java.
- JVM creates an object but it requires a blueprint.

- Thus, you create a class file that class file gets compiled to create a byte code and that byte code goes to the JVM and then JVM creates an object.


class Demo
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		
	}
}
